# 1. Seeing Current Directory (a directory is a file)
## First, let's do this in finder or the document search tool
pwd

# 2. Changing Directories
## First, let's do this in finder or the document search tool
cd /
### This took me to my "root" directory
pwd
## Let's instead go to our "home" directory
cd ~
pwd

# 3. Go back a directory
pwd
cd ..
pwd

# 4. See the contents of your current directory
cd ~
ls

# 4. Creating Directories
mkdir new_directory
ls

# 4. Create a file
## I will start by showing you how to create a text file in nano
## However, I encourage you to explore other text editing software
## Watch the "TextEditing" video on Canvas (under Media Gallery)
nano new_python_file.py
## While directories don't have suffixes, files should
ls
## Try opening it in a different text editor

## ** THE FOLLOWING IS IN PYTHON ** ##
# Assigning Variables
name = "Steph"
age = 34

# Printing variables
print(name)
print(age)

# Print variables with a message
print("Hello, " + name + ", you are " + age + " years old.")
## Why didn't this work??
## Variables can be of different types
type(name)
type(age)
### A string is a sequence of characters
### An int is a whole number
age_string = str(age)
type(age_string)
print("Hello, " + name + ", you are " + age_string + " years old.")

# Performing Basic Arithmetic
earth_days_in_a_year = 365
mercury_days_in_a_year = 88
age_days = earth_days_in_a_year * 34
mercury_age = age_days / 88
print("You have lived for approximiately " + str(age_days) + " days.")
print("You would be " + str(mercury_age) + " years old on Mercury.")

# You can also have the user provide information for a variable
gene_name = input("Provide the gene name: ")
gene_seq = input("Provide the gene sequence: ")

# Python has inherant "methods" you can use
# Here is one called input that allows the user to provide content that gets assigned to a variable
name = input("What is your name? ")
# Here is one called len that measures the length of a string (number of characters)
gene_length = len(gene_seq)
# This is the number of nucleotides in a gene.
# However, is DNA single or double stranded?
# How many total nucleotides are at this region if you consider both sides of the DNA molecule?
nucs = gene_length * 2
# How many base pairs are there in this gene? How would you calculate it?
bp = gene_length
# Assuming this is a protein-coding gene, how many amino acids are in the translated protein?
aa = gene_length / 3
